# 360 Frame

360 Frame is a full-stack web application for image management that uses a Laravel-based CMS for the backend and a Vue 3 (PWA) for the frontend. It enables users to upload images with captions and visibility settings, view them in a personal library or on a public gallery, and even enjoy an immersive 360째 viewer built with Three.js. The app also supports offline viewing by caching image metadata with IndexedDB.Three.js.
